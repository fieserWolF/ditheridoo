# Ditheridoo

**Dither me like one of your French girls.**

Ditheridoo is a multicolor bitmap editor for Commodore 64.
It runs on 64 bit versions of Linux, MacOS, Windows and other systems supported by Python.

# Why Ditheridoo?

reason | description
---|---
open source | easy to modify and to improve, any useful contribution is highly welcome
portable | available on Linux, MacOS, Windows and any other system supported by Python3
easy dithering | checkerboard, x-line, y-line, light dither modes available, more might be implemented in the future
interesting for coders | total control which values are set in draw-modes "select color" and "dye", see built-in help or [cheatsheet.md](cheatsheet.md) for details


# Usage

For a list of quick keyboard shortcuts and other information see file [cheatsheet.md](cheatsheet.md) or the full documentation in /doc.



# File Format

The multicolor bitmap is stored in the widely-spread KoalaPainter (C64) format:

* 2 bytes load address
* 8000 bytes raw bitmap data
* 1000 bytes raw "Video Matrix" (screen) data
* 1000 bytes raw "Color RAM" data
* 1 byte background data

# Getting Started

Ditheridoo comes in two flavors:

- standalone executable for 64-bit systems Linux, MacOS/Darwin and Windows (see [releases](https://github.com/fieserWolF/ditheridoo/releases))
- Python3 script

## Run the standalone executable

Just download your bundle at [releases](https://github.com/fieserWolF/ditheridoo/releases) and enjoy.
Keep in mind that only 64bit systems are supported as I could not find a 32bit system to generate the bundle.


### Note for Windows users

If some antivirus scanner puts Ditheridoo into quarantine because it suspects a trojan or virus, simply put it out there again.
It isn`t harmful, I used PyInstaller to bundle the standalone executable for you.
Unfortunately, the PyInstaller bootloader triggers a false alarm on some systems.
I even tried my best and re-compiled the PyInstaller bootloader so that this should not happen anymore. Keep your fingers crossed ;)


### Note for MacOS users

Your system might complain that the code is not signed by a certificated developer. Well, I am not, so I signed the program on my own. 
```
"Ditheridoo" can`t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
```
You need to right-click or Control-click the app and select “Open”.



## Run the Python3 script directly

Download _ditheridoo.py_ and the whole _resource_ - directory into the same folder on your computer.

### Prerequisites

At least this is needed to run the script directly:

- python 3
- python tkinter module
- python "The Python Imaging Library" (PIL)

Normally, you would use pip like this:
```
pip3 install tk pillow
```

On my Debian GNU/Linux machine I use apt-get to install everything needed:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install python3 python3-tk python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk
```


# Changelog

## Future plans

- implement sanity check: accept only standard koala format files
- implement real undo for all functions
- implement hires drawing mode
- implement different pencil sizes
- implement: freely adjustable edit window
- maybe: preview window: indicate current view with a visible frame
- maybe: preview window: move visible frame by dragging the mouse
- maybe: "draw mode: select": avoid moving of the controls


Any help and support in any form is highly appreciated.
